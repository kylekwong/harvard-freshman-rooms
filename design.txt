    My CS50 final project, Harvard Room Maps, is essentially a collection of maps (made on my own). My project is based on problem
set 7, as it is written primarily in PHP and uses a SQL database. I also used some of the files from problem set 7, especially
the functions.php file, since they provided to be extremely helpful in making my website.
    I decided to use a SQL database to store all of the individual rooms and corresponding entryways/floors because the SQL database,
when used wisely, makes locating and modifying data extremely quickly and easily. Even though my table was significantly larger than
the table we used in problem set 7, retrieving information from the SQL database still seems incredibly fast. As you can see from the
home page, each freshman dorm has its own .php file; however, they are all rendered using the same template, and the code in the .php
files themselves are very similar (the only real difference between each .php file for the dorms is the title variable that is passed
into the template).
    The template displays a table with all of the rooms in a certain dorm (depending on which .php file is loaded) with their
corresponding entryways and floors. The information comes directly from the SQL table, and there is no noticeable lag time when
loading the pages, though this may be much more pronounced if we were to use a computer to measure how much time the page takes to load.
Each room is linked to a map of the floor on which it belongs. I set up each image of the floors so that they could be accessed through
some variation of "http://final/img/(dormname)/(dormname)_(entryway)_floor_(floornumber)". I did this so that it would be much easier
to write more generic code that could link to any of the maps instead of hard-coding links for every single map.
