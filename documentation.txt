(This documentation assumes usage on the CS50 appliance)

    Hello, and welcome to the documentation for my CS50 final project, Harvard Room Maps! Since this project was made
using some parts, especially the functions, from problem set 7, setting it up for use is also similar to problem set 7. First,
you'll want to download the zip file to the CS50 appliance. Next, unzip the file by running the command "unzip final.zip" in the
terminal. You should now have a folder called "final" which contains all of the files needed for the website to work. Next, to make
things easier, you'll want to move the folder into your ~/vhosts directory. Next you'll have to change the access permissions in
order to view files in your browser, and it will make it much easier if the file is in the ~/vhosts directory.
    To change the access permissions, using a terminal window, you will want to run the commands "chmod a+x ~", "chmod a+x ~/vhosts",
"chmod a+x ~/vhosts/final", "chmod a+x ~/vhosts/final/public" in order to make all of the files within those directories executable
by everyone (especially you!). Next, you'll want to change directories so that you are in the public directory within final. To do
so, you can run the command "cd ~/vhosts/final/public". The directory "public" also has four subdirectories, css, img, js, and font,
which we will also want to make executable, since they contain important files (especially img!). To do this, use the command 
"chmod a+x css img js font" while you are in the public directory. Next, we also want to make the files within each of those 
subdirectories readable (again, especially img, since it contains all the pictures of the dorm maps). We can achieve this by running
the command "chmod a+r css/* img/* js/* font/*". Next, so that we can access final and all of its goodness in our browser, we will
have to associate the CS50 appliance's IP address with final, which we can do by executing "sudo gedit /etc/hosts" in a terminal window
and then adding "127.0.0.1 final" to the end of the document that pops up (without changing anything else!). Make sure you save, and 
then exit that window. 
    Almost there! Finally, before we can start using the website, we need to update the mySQL database. Included in the final folder is
a file called "rooms.sql". If you open it in gedit, you can see that it contains all of the freshman dorm rooms as well as their
corresponding entryways and floor numbers. If you examine it more closely, though, you may realize that the entire document is actually
written in SQL (standard query language, hence the .sql extension), which contains the instructions needed to make a table containing
all of the dorm information in your mySQL database. To do this, you can copy the full length of the rooms.sql document, and then head to
http://final/phpmyadmin/sql.php where you can then click the SQL tab at the top, and then paste the code into the box and press "Go"
at the bottom right hand corner of the page to execute it. If nothing went wrong, you should now be ready to go!
    To access the home page of the website, simply go into your web browser (Google Chrome) and type in http://final where you should then
see a giant "Harvard Room Maps" at the top of the page. The website itself is extremely easy to use. You can browse through maps by
clicking on any of the dorm names at the home page and then clicking on any room number on the next page, which will then bring you to
a map of the floor on which that room is. You can also search for a room at the home page by typing in the name of the dorm and the number
(make sure you include the preceding letter if the room number includes a letter, i.e. Wigglesworth A11 (without the hyphen)).
